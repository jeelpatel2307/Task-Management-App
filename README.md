## Explanation of Code

### `app.py`

This is the main Python file where the Flask application is defined. It handles routes for creating, updating, deleting, and viewing tasks.

### `index.html`

This HTML file displays the list of tasks and allows users to interact with them. Users can create new tasks, update existing ones, and mark tasks as completed.

### `style.css`

This file contains the CSS styling for the application, providing a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication for secure access to tasks.
- Implement features like due dates, priorities, and categories for tasks.
- Improve the UI/UX to make the app more visually appealing and intuitive.
